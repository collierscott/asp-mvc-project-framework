Usage
-----

Starting a new projects

1.  Create a new folder to contain your projects.
2.  Clone the project into the directory that was just created.
3.  In your new folder, double-click on the Template.sln file to open up the solution.
4.  Rename the Solution.
5.  Close and reopen the Solution.
6.  Delete demo code this includes controller, model, and view. This also includes any code in IAppReposirty, AppRepository, IAppService, AppService, IMenuService, and MenuService.
7.  Optional: Delete any java scripts you don't need and adjust the _Layout page as needed. For example, If you don't need Highcharts, you can delete the highcharts folder.

Notes
-----

If you are making changes to the code and they don't seem to be applied to the application, go to Project | WebUI.Properties in the top menu. Select Web and change the port number in the project Url text box.
Visual studio creates virtual directories and, because the template is copied over, sometimes the changes don't seem to be applied to the renamed template. This usually happens when you have the original Template solution open at the same time as the renamed solution.
